# Optimal mix in heterogeneous ensemble learner (2018, HU Berlin)

<h2>Abstract</h2>

In factor analysis the scientist influences model construction. He determines estimation of communalities, the number of factors, extraction- and rotation-method as well as the inter- pretation. In order to compare factor models and to indentify the impact of decisions an interactive application is developed. A comparison of several models using data of personality items confirms the importance of model construction, even though all models result in fac- tors that relate to the same variables. Small differences in axis location, simplicity of loading structure and interpretation of factors can be detected. Furthermore a dependency between preferred model construction and the examined data is unveiled.
